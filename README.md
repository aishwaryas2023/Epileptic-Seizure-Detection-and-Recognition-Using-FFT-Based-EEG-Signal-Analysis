# Epileptic-Seizure-Detection-and-Recognition-Using-FFT-Based-EEG-Signal-Analysis
This project aims to explore and implement suitable ML algorithms using MATLAB to detect and classify seizures from EEG data. MATLAB provides tools like the Classification Learner App, Signal Processing Toolbox, and Deep Learning Toolbox, making it a strong platform for signal-based ML tasks.
